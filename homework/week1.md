#Week 1
## Monday, Day 1
## Tuesday, Day 2
## Wednesday, Day 3 
1. **Reading:** *15 minutes* When a web browser displays a page, it's not just showing the contents of an HTML file. It also creates a structure that JavaScript can interact with. This structure is called the Document Object Model (DOM). Unlike the HTML file, the DOM can change over time -- and we can change it with JavaScript! The DOM is vitally important for dynamic web pages where elements are added, removed, or changed over time. Read this <a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/dom/tutorials/introduction">brief introduction to the DOM.</a>

1. **Activity**: *45 minutes* Open the Chrome dev tools with `Cmd` + `Opt` + `i`, and find the Elements tab.

    * You'll be learning some new ways to edit sites in Chrome. You can make changes to the Developer Guide sections listed below, the site you worked on this afternoon, or a live website you visit often. If you come up with something you like, you can share a screenshot on slack!
    * Try out features from Chrome's [Developer Guide on Editing the DOM](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/inspect-styles/edit-dom), up to and including the "Edit DOM nodes and attributes" section.  
    * Try  out features from the Developer guide on [Editing Styles](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/inspect-styles/edit-styles), up to and including the "Add a new property declaration" section.

2. **Activity** *45-60 mins* If you haven't already, complete your exercises from today's lectures.  Once you have done so, you can go [here](http://try.jquery.com/) to try some more guided exercises to work on your knowledge of JQuery and the DOM.  There are six sections with many different exercises.  The first four sections touch upon the different concepts you explored today regarding JQuery and the DOM.  Work in as many sections as needed to bolster your knowledge!!
