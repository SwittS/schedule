1. **Reading:** *15 minutes* When a web browser displays a page, it's not just showing the contents of an HTML file. It also creates a structure that JavaScript can interact with. This structure is called the Document Object Model (DOM). Unlike the HTML file, the DOM can change over time -- and we can change it with JavaScript! The DOM is vitally important for dynamic web pages where elements are added, removed, or changed over time. Read this <a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/dom/tutorials/introduction">brief introduction to the DOM.</a>

1. **Activity**: *45 minutes* Open the Chrome dev tools with `Cmd` + `Opt` + `i`, and find the Elements tab.
