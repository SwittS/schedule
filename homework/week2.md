2. If you have more time, make sure to take another look at the [Giphy/AJAX Lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-30/giffaw) and keep working on it. - You can also take a look at the [solution branches](https://github.com/sf-wdi-30/giffaw/tree/solution).





## Day 3
<!--
1. Prepare yourself for Object Oriented Programming!  This is a monumental cornestone in modern development patterns.  What better way to familiarize yourself with a new topic than to watch a video?  Today's homework is to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS-9y0H3Si8) video over and over and over until you can safely and comfortably discuss differences between a Class/Object and a attribute/method.  

Please use any remaining time to complete and review the exercises from dawn & dusk.  Do something awesome with Handlebars!

## Day 4

<!--
1. Complete the weekly pulse check by 5pm today! Here are the links to the forms for  [27](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1T_hslq10E362HJ6a_qU_qq-23izCZmwQ9NrYAdxDrlI/viewform) and [28](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-Sxe_a5Zwlh2ifkd5fjwJKTl7GOIlR7WvC5xCWkS7ls/viewform).
1. Prepare for your weekend project!
    - You are going to be making a game. Read through [the project description](https://github.com/sf-wdi-27-28/project-00). 
    - Using the concepts of Object Oriented Programming you encountered today, we want you to model the game that you'll be building over the weekend.
      - Write out a list of all of the objects that the game will require to run.
      - Name all of the properties and methods that each of those objects will require for the game to run properly. What properties will the objects need to describe them? What will the objects need to do?
      - Example: If I were making the game of soccer, I would have a field object, a ball object, team objects (built with a team object constructor), player objects (built with a player object constructor) and a clock object (to keep track of the game's progress). The player objects would have properties like `hasPossessionOfBall`, `name`, `number`, `position`, and `stats`. Every player object would have methods like `dribble()`, `pass()`, `shoot()`, `defend()`, `steal()`, and `throwIn()`.
      - Take a few minutes to pseudocode each of the methods that you have come up with.
1. Friday Review Prep

    - Ask and/or upvote 3 questions on QuestionCookie: http://www.questioncookie.com/wdi-27-28-w2-review
