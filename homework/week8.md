# Week 8 Homework

The homeworks and readings below are intended to prepare you for the next day's lectures. Please complete them first.

If you have any remaining time, please complete/review the exercises from dawn and dusk lectures. You can also review the morning drills.


## Day 1

1. In preparation for tomorrow, please familiarize yourself with the following:
    * First, make sure that you're comfortable with how to represent [1:1, 1:N, &amp; N:N Relationships](http://www.databaseprimer.com/pages/table-relationships/) in database tables.
      * What would your table relationships look like for: `drivers, vehicles, drivers licenses`, and `zoos, animals caretakers` (we will go over this in class!)
    * Then, read all about Active Record:
      * Setting up database tables with [Migrations](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html) - All of it!
      * Setting up model relationships with [Associations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html) - Only sections [1](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#migration-overview) and [2.0-2.4](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#the-types-of-associations)!
2. If you have any remaining time, try adding Auth to an existing Rails App (like Bog App or Rock-n-Rails).
